# TensorFlow_TextGenerator
A Text-Generator that uses TensorFlow to train a LSTM model for a given text file and generates text in that style by predicting single chars for a desired text length.
This code was created as a private project while learning machine learning concepts. Therefore not everything is perfectly implemented and fully configurable, but has enough possibilities to play around and experiment with different settings.
